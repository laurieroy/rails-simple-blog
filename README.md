# Simple Blog - WIP
This was built following a [code-along](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCEzxY9BbiU) by [TechmakerTV](https://www.techmaker.tv/content/building-a-blog-with-rails-6-part-1). I found it tyring to get impressive to work on another project and decided to follow along...

Authors have a special layout with more granular admin control of posts. Publish is a StimulusReflex. The various elements can be rearranged using SortableJS.


### Gems
* devise for auth
* active_storage for images
* rich_text for formatting text
* stimulusJS for reflex actions - publish, unpublish
* sortableJS to rearrange elements by drag-n-drop 

Ruby 2.6.3 | Rails 6.1.3 | PG | Bootsrap with FontAwesome UI  | 

### TODO:
- clean up Stimulus
- fix JS
- hack for sortable (elements_reflex)
- sortable broke after adding in chart.js
